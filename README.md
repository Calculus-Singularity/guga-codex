# gugugaga

Clean wrapper repository around the Codex upstream.

## Structure

- `codex/`: git submodule pointing to `https://github.com/Calculus-Singularity/codex`
- root: lightweight wrapper metadata for this repo

## Legacy Snapshot

Previous Sentra-era code was exported out of this repository to:

- `/tmp/gugugaga-old-snapshot-20260222_012720`
- `/tmp/gugugaga-old-snapshot-20260222_012720.tar.gz`

So this repository can stay clean while old code remains available for reference.
